# Simple Multiplayer Card Game
## Overview
The Simple Multiplayer Card Game is a web application designed to facilitate a two-player card game. This project has served as a valuable learning platform to practice for an upcoming board game project. It provided an opportunity to delve into the integration of WebSocket for real-time communication and Spring Boot for robust backend development. Through this project, I have learned how to manage game states, handle player interactions, and ensure a seamless multiplayer experience.
